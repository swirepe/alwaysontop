# alwaysontop.sh

## What is it?

It keeps your bash prompt at the top of the screen.  It also:

* clears the screen automatically
* lists the contents of directories upon entering them
* abbreviates those contents of there would be too many.
* shows the git or svn status in directories that have them

## Why?

I had a pretty long train commute, and I found that at the end of it, my neck would hurt from hunching.

## How do I use it?

Source (don't run) the file `alwaysontop.sh`.  Turn it off with unautotop.  From the help output:

    alwaysontop.sh - keep the prompt at the top of the screen.
    Included commands:

	alwaysontop_help  This screen

	autotop           Turn ON always on top and autoclear
